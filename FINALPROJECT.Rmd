## Introduction

The way we listen to music today is very different from the way we listened to music 50 years ago. We have substantially more freedom when it comes to selecting which songs we want to listen to and when, and this fact, among many others, has influenced the way that music is produced. Before streaming services like Spotify and Apple music came around, if you wanted to have constant access to a song, it would likely cost you about a dollar. For the price of one (undiscounted) Spotify subscription, you could listen to a grand total of ten new songs per month. With Spotify, if you played new music continuously for every minute of the month, you could listen to approximately 14,600 new songs (assuming an average song is three minutes long and there is no repetition) a month. While this example does not represent conventional use, in the most extreme case, you could save $14,590 in one month by purchasing a Spotify subscription in 2020 instead of individually purchasing each song through the iTunes store circa 2010. This situation is made even more unrealistic by the fact that the iPod you had in 2010 had enough store for only 7,000 songs, given that you paid extra for the 32 GB model. But I digress; historically, people listened to what was on the radio and often selected 

To say the least, times have changed. 

Today's producers have adapted to this change.

## The Question: What do listeners want to hear, and how does it vary by genre? 
Can we predict the popularity of a song based on the metrics provided by Spotify for each genre?

## Data Curation
First, we import the song data. For sake of ease, we remove songs with any missing attributes from the dataframe. Then, using the unique track_id of each song, we check for (and remove) duplicate listings. This is the only place we will make use of track_id, so we remove that column from the dataframe. Finally, we remove the time_signature column, leaving us with only attributes that can be normalized in a meaningful manner. Rearranging the dataframe so that char attributes are in the first columns and numeric attributes make up the rest make it easier to grab either of those when we need to.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Read in data
tunes_tab <- read_csv("ultimate-spotify-tracks-db/SpotifyFeatures.csv")
#Remove any incomplete data
tunes_tab <- na.omit(tunes_tab)
#Remove any duplicate song listings
tunes_tab <- tunes_tab[!duplicated(tunes_tab$track_id),]
#Remove track ID column
tunes_tab$track_id <- NULL
#Remove time signature column 
tunes_tab$time_signature <- NULL
#Rearrange dataframe to separate char and double attributes
tunes_tab <- tunes_tab[,c(1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16)]
#Show a tibble of the new dataframe 
tunes_tab

```



## Parsing and Data Management

Next, we normalize each of the numeric attributes except for popularity, which will be handled differently. 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Normalize the numeric attributes
stand_tunes <- as.data.frame(scale(tunes_tab[7:16]))
non_numeric <- tunes_tab[1:6]
#Update tunes_tab with normalized attributes
tunes_tab <- cbind(non_numeric, stand_tunes)
#Fixing the issue of two different "Children's Music" genres caused by differently formatted apostrophes 
tunes_tab$genre[tunes_tab$genre == "Children's Music"] <- "Childrenâ€™s Music"
tunes_tab <- tunes_tab %>% 
  mutate(new_pop = as.factor(case_when(((popularity >= 0) & (popularity < 10)) ~ "1",
                         ((popularity >= 10) & (popularity < 20))~ "2",
                         ((popularity >= 20) & (popularity < 30)) ~ "3",
                         ((popularity >= 30) & (popularity < 40)) ~ "4",
                         ((popularity >= 40) & (popularity < 50)) ~ "5",
                         ((popularity >= 50) & (popularity < 60)) ~ "6",
                         ((popularity >= 60) & (popularity < 70)) ~ "7",
                         ((popularity >= 70) & (popularity < 80)) ~ "8",
                         ((popularity >= 80) & (popularity < 90)) ~ "9",
                         ((popularity >= 90)) ~ "10")))
#View summary data of attributes
summary(stand_tunes)
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

Now it is time to analyze what we have so far. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)

plot <- tunes_tab[sample(nrow(tunes_tab), 1000), ] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=danceability, y=popularity))+
  geom_point()+
  dark_theme_gray()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(x="Danceability",y="Popularity", title="Danceability vs Popularity")
plot <- plot +
  theme(
     rect = element_rect(fill = "#222222"), # all rectangles
     panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#222222")
   
  )
plot
```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
feature_names <- names(tunes_tab)[7:16]
plot <- tunes_tab %>%
  select(c('new_pop', feature_names)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = feature_names) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = new_pop), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 3, scales = 'free') +
  labs(title = 'Features vs Popularity',
       x = '', y = 'Popularity') +
  dark_theme_gray()
plot <- plot +
  theme(
     rect = element_rect(fill = "#222222"), # all rectangles
     panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "#222222"),
    
  ) 
plot
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)

plot <- tunes_tab[sample(nrow(tunes_tab), 1000), ] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=loudness, y = popularity))+
  geom_point()+
  dark_theme_gray()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(x="Loudness",y="Popularity", title="Loudness vs Popularity")
plot <- plot +
  theme(
     rect = element_rect(fill = "#222222"), # all rectangles
     panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#222222")
   
  )
plot
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggcorrplot)
feature_names <- names(tunes_tab)[6:16]
tunes_tab %>%
  select(feature_names) %>%
  scale() %>%
  cor() %>%
  ggcorrplot(type = "upper", hc.order = TRUE, colors = brewer.pal(n = 7, name = "Spectral")) + dark_theme_gray()

```



```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot <- tunes_tab %>%
  select(c('genre', feature_names)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = feature_names) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = genre), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 3, scales = 'free') +
  labs(title = 'Song Features vs Genre',
       x = '', y = 'density') +
  dark_theme_gray()
plot <- plot +
  theme(
     rect = element_rect(fill = "#222222"), # all rectangles
     panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#222222"),
    
  ) 
plot
```











## Hypothesis Testing and Machine Learning

Finally, it is time to build the model.
